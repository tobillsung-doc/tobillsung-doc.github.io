Sophie opened the refrigerator and asked<br />
"Is this juice? The orange bluish thing on the shelf ..."<br />
She was pointing at the Tropicalia from Creator Comfort.

"That is IPA. You should not drink it unless you want to be in a big trouble"<br />
She had a little frown on her face and replied back.<br />
"What's IPA? I'm thirsty. There is no lactose free milk or nothing here"

What a usual way to embrace the Sunday afternoon !

'Lactose free, gluten free, soy free,  blah blah free'. <br />
Then, I wondered when I started to only drink IPAs.

It was not long ago that I drank two cans of Coors Lite from my brother-in-law's.
The beer did not taste anything I really wanted, but it brought me some nostalgic moments.
When I looked at my wife, she rolled her eyes and said<br />
"I know what you are thinking. Yes, we used to have this beer when we just got married. 
We did not have any money, and this was the beer everybody had back then. You loved it so much"

Well, fair enough. I used to buy it on Fridays. 
I don't know why but I wanted to celebrate myself for surviving another week of boring PhD in Georgia Tech.
The true thing is that my wife worked ass off during these boring days. 
When Sophie was born, she was already ready to execute combos when the **things** are at her distance:  

```
st.HK -> st.LK xx HP.shoryu xx CA
I don't play Ryu in sfv. My wife does ... I will make post about this later
```

I don't know when, but I started to realize that the quality matters more than the quantity. 
Instead of filling belly with 6-pack, I stared to respect the beer making process:<br /> 
The trial & error, A/B test, optimizing hyper-parameters in machine learning algorithms (maybe I went too far on this)  
    
Anyway, it was in Chicago, our family got exposed to many foodies. 
The environment introduced our family to local restaurants and new budget system where cost related food is allocated more than 30% of total. 
Organic produces from Whole Food became natural to us, and coconut water tasted like the water from Samaritan.
One bottle of beer can cost up to 12 dollars and it did taste like beer mixed with vodka.

Along the way, I met IPA, to be little bit more specific, American India Pale Ale.
This friend has helped me justify my 6-month pregnant belly.

Some friends never like the taste of it, because it has too much hop to ruin the balance among
water, grain, hop, yeast (Beer-101). My dad also mentioned that the taste profile of IPA was very up & down
when compared to his favorite Weihenstaphaner Hefeweissbie. 
I can understand that the taste is very different from the flat crisp / chill taste from lager (no offense boys)    
However, I enjoyed this amazing taste before another gulp of happiness follows.

You may ask, how come Tropicalia? I've never heard about this before.<br />
I also like Sculpin, Stone Double Dried Hop, Jai Alai, Two Hearted Ale, 90 Minutes, Little Sumpin ...     

But **But !** <br />
Tropicalia is from Athens, GA where my wife went to school. Any bulldog fans here?<br />
So, I told my 6-month monster to keep coming back to Tropicalia.
