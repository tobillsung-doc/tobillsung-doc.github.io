It is 3AM in the morning. I took a nap around 8PM and woke up 11PM super energized.

I saw the last blog written in 2018. It is now **2020**!

2020 has been really sad due to Covid-19 virus. I've been working from home since early March and
you'd better wear a mask whenever you go out. USA started to open shops, restaurants in June, 
but we are seeing second wave of infection.

If you are reading this from the future, you should understand this is not easy for us... 

Anyway, lots of things changed since my last post.

- My teenage daughter graduated from middle school. 
- I changed job to become senior data scientist.
- Our cute Daisy is no longer with us. I could not post the tribute video that my wife made. I always end up crying.

- We adopted Mocha on a very hot Sunday in 2019. She is no longer puppy now.

- What else? Gain 10lb to follow the mid-age husbandango trend ???

Time flies and sometime I just want to leap that time
