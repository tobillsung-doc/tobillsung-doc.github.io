Has it ever occurred to you that making a shot becomes a part of meditation?

For me, it is.
When I need to calm down, I brew coffee. 
It is a series of processes.
Heat up the water to the right temperature, grind the bean to the right size. 
Lastly, pour the hot water to brew coffee beans.

But, I do feel something along the way.
The steam from a brewing cup makes my glasses shy. 
Dripping sound of coffee makes my ears cozy.

Hey kiddo, just close your eyes and listen to the truth: the thing you've waited for a long time.
If coffee turns out to be bitter, well, you will make another one later. For now, I'm just making coffee.

Ciao,
